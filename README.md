Working on a near-perfect opencore config for my ThinkPad P73 (UHD, i7-9750H, 32 GB RAM).

All good except Battery Status and Fingerprint reader this far.

Upgraded OpenCore release to 0.7.0 and edited the config.plist to match.

Searching for patched battery ACPI files for the battery issue or I will have to 
try to make one, which seems quite a chore.

There is a rev-eng of the Synaptic Metallica MIS fingerprint device available
with some arch/AUR package. Could be portable to macOS.
