Working on a near-perfect opencore config for my ThinkPad P73 (UHD, i7-9750H, 32 GB RAM).

All good except: 

* Nvidia dGPU drivers missing, so only iGPU.
* Fingerprint reader (Synaptic Mew                                                                              tallica MIS).

Upgraded OpenCore release to 0.7.0 and edited the config.plist to match.


There is a rev-eng of the Synaptic Metallica MIS fingerprint device available
with some arch/AUR package. Could be portable to macOS.
